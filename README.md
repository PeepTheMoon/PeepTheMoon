**Hello!** :sparkles:

I'm Rachel, a software engineer who loves to play great songs terribly on the ukulele.  

I love to learn and believe *everything* is interesting. Due to my insatiable curiosity, I have a large mental database of strange animal facts, sych as: 
* There's a caterpillar who saves its outgrown heads and wears them like hats :bug:
* Some toads hatch babies from holes in their backs :frog:

When I'm not coding, I create art.  You can check out some of my stuff [here](https://www.instagram.com/peepthemoonstudios/?hl=en):crescent_moon:
