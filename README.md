**Hello!** :sparkles:

I'm Rachel, a software engineer with a sophomoric sense of humor who loves to play great songs terribly on the ukulele.  

I love to learn and believe *everything* is interesting if you're talking to the right person. Due to my insatiable curiosity, I now have a large mental database of strange animal facts, like:
* Lobsters that pee from their faces 
* Caterpillars who save their outgrown heads and wear them like hats 
* Moles who store troves of paralyzed worms in underground dens
* Toads that hatch babies from their backs.  

In my spare time I create art.  You can check out some of my stuff [here](https://www.instagram.com/peepthemoonstudios/?hl=en):crescent_moon:
