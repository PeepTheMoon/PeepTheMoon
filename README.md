**Hello!** :sparkles:

I'm Rachel, a software engineer who plays great songs terribly on the ukulele.  

I love to learn and believe *everything* is interesting. I enjoy working with data get excited about ways to visualize information for quick, clear, efficient communication.

When I'm not coding, I create art.  You can check out some of my work [here](https://www.instagram.com/peepthemoonstudios/?hl=en):crescent_moon:
