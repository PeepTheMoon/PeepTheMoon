**Hello!** :crescent_moon:

I'm Rachel, a software engineer with a sophomoric sense of humor who loves to play great songs terribly on the ukulele.  

I love to learn and believe *EVERYTHING* is interesting if you're talking to the right person. Due to my insatiable curiosity, I now have a large mental database of strange animal facts, like lobsters that pee from their faces, caterpillars who save their outgrown heads and wear them like hats, moles who store troves of paralyzed worms in underground dens, and toads that hatch babies from their backs.  

In my spare time I create art.  You can check out some of my stuff [here](https://www.instagram.com/peepthemoonstudios/?hl=en):sparkles:
